During my job hunt (long delay in blog posts also caused by university busies), 
I've been writing a few open source apps for Android that I hope to release on 
both the Play Market and F-Droid. If you're interested in checking them out 
and testing them, here's a list of them:

* [AeonDroid](https://github.com/phora/Aeondroid) - A planetary hours app that will soon 
have alerts configurable for planetary hours and moon phases. Currently just calculates
and displays the planetary hours.
* [AndroPTPB](https://github.com/phora/AndroPTPB) - An open source client for
<https://ptpb.pw>, an open source pastebin
* [AndroTSH](https://github.com/phora/AndroTSH) - An open source client for 
<https://transfer.sh>, an open source site for temporarily transferring files
